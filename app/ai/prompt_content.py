Information about the dog:
Dental Health:
I generally brush my dogs teeth may be once per month and give her dental sticks around once per week. 

General wellbeing:
I generally do not take her to vet, I take her only if she is sick. I am not sure if I have given her flea treatment at all, I generally bath her daily with soap brought from pet store.

Body Problems:
Lately I am seeing her scratch or lick her excessively daily and her coat lacks shine despite me giving her bath daily with soap.
No it does not smell of any fishy odour.

Gut Health:
She does not have any vomiting or diarrhoea or eat its own faeces at all.

Bone Health:
My dog is not stiff when its first gets up and is active and never lags behind.

Mental Health:
My dog does once in a while whine when I leave the house, however she has never been aggressive towards others or with me. She is very cordial.
