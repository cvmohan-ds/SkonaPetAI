        "Assessment": "Based on the information provided, your dog is exhibiting signs of mobility issues and joint pain, such as stiffness when getting up, limping, and struggling with specific movements like climbing stairs or getting up from lying down.

A change in activity level and behavior further supports this assessment.\",",
        "Recommendation": "It is crucial to schedule a veterinary examination as soon as possible to evaluate your dog's bone health and determine the underlying cause of their mobility issues. Your vet may recommend diagnostic tests, such as X-rays, to assess the extent of the problem. Depending on the diagnosis, treatment options may include pain management, anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, or even surgery. Additionally, consider implementing lifestyle changes, such as providing a comfortable sleeping area, maintaining a healthy weight, and engaging in low-impact exercises to support your dog's joint health."

Your dog also shows signs of mobility issues and joint pain, including stiffness, limping, and difficulty with specific movements. However, your dog's gut health seems to be in good condition with no recent upset stomachs or fishy odor.\",",
